### Hi!

My name is Jim Barrett and I've been a full stack software engineer for over 12 years.

I got my start building web sites in the days of PHP 4...back when you might have a Flash video player 
embedded in your page and you had to code everything to work with Internet Explorer 6.

I still really enjoy working with PHP whenever possible but I also spend a lot of time working with Python, 
NodeJS, React, Angular, etc... To me the product that I'm building is far more important than the tools that 
I'm using to build it. Anyway, mostly I just really like to be constantly learning something new...which is 
the reason I started programmming in the first place.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently playing around with NextJS [here](https://github.com/jimbarrett/bible-verse-lookup).
- 
As of Sept. 2023 I'm currently on the market and looking for a new position! Check out my [resume](https://jimbarrett.github.io/resume/) 
and feel free to reach out if you want to talk!
